### About
This is the repository for my personal website, created using [11ty](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy).

There isn’t much to see here — especially if you're a developer. It’s a very basic 11ty setup.

Primarily for my own reference (since I'm not a developer), I’ve documented most of the steps and features I used while building this site. You can find them in the [Wiki pages](https://github.com/ntoesnet/mySite/wiki).
