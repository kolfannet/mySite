I've decided to try a monthly subscription to Frontend Masters. I want to check out a specific course: JavaScript: From First Steps to Professional. Why? Because I've been experimenting with 11ty quite a lot, and having zero coding experience is kind of limiting.<!-- excerpt --> 

Plus, Iâ€™ve had the idea of creating my own running log with 11ty, and I think taking a JavaScript course is the right move for me right now. 

Well, another right move would be to actually start running and collect some real workout data I could use later on .-)
